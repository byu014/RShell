# rshell
This project uses C++ to emulate the linux terminal by running programs found in /bin/. It is designed to run any number of those programs given the correct commands. For example: ls whoami echo pwd mkdir

Additionally commands can be linked by common connectors (&& || and ;) and comments are also detected and properly parsed.
